Bindings are in CEF_bindings folder, there is an example of how to use the API in examples. There are 3 examples, 1 for letting chome handle the window, 1 where you provide a win32 window handle, and 1 using offscreen rendering and then rendering the image to a opengl window.
Note there are quite a lot of files which are required to be placed next to the exe file. 

** Windows only ** for now, please feel free to add linux/mac support and open a pull request.
