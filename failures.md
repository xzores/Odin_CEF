# Translation Failures Log

## 1. Linter Errors in cef_app_capi.odin
- **Description:** Linter errors reported for undeclared names (e.g., command_line, scheme_registrar, resource_bundle_handler, etc.).
- **Context:** These are expected and correct, as Odin translation uses forward declarations for dependencies that have not yet been translated. This matches the translation notes and is not a true error.

## 2. Tool Call Exceeded Max Tokens (cef_browser_capi.h)
- **Description:** Attempted to translate the entire cef_browser_capi.h file, but the tool call exceeded the maximum number of tokens and failed.
- **Context:** The file is very large (over 1000 lines). Future translations should be done in smaller, focused chunks (e.g., struct-by-struct or section-by-section) to avoid this issue.

## 3. Successful Translations Completed
- **Description:** Successfully translated multiple files following established patterns:
  - cef_audio_handler_capi.odin
  - cef_client_capi.odin  
  - cef_command_line_capi.odin
  - cef_cookie_capi.odin
- **Context:** All translations follow snake_case naming, use forward declarations for dependencies, and maintain the established translation patterns. Linter errors are expected and correct due to forward declarations.
